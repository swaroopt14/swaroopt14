"""
RCA HDBSCAN model for Zord payment intelligence.

Lifecycle:
  1. Bootstrap: scripts/train_rca_model.py produces a .pkl bundle from labeled CSV.
  2. Startup:   RCAModel loads the .pkl; if absent, predict() returns [] gracefully.
  3. Inference: predict(candidates) uses approximate_predict() on the loaded bundle.
  4. Retrain:   maybe_retrain_async() fires a background thread when enough new labeled
                batches have accumulated.  The in-memory bundle is swapped atomically
                under RLock so inference is never blocked.

Bundle layout (joblib-serialized RCABundle):
  pipeline         — fitted sklearn ColumnTransformer
  hdbscan_model    — fitted HDBSCAN (prediction_data=True)
  cluster_label_map — dict[int, str]  e.g. {3: "MCR", 7: "USL"}
  feature_contract_version — "rca_v1"
